    <h2>Submission info:</h2>
    <p>In my midterm project, I wanted to create a tutorial on how to use my digital audio Production software of
        choice, being Cubase LE AI Elements 11. I chose this because I knew it was a topic I could easily put a lot of
        depth into if I needed to, and I already know so much about the software so I didn't have to do any research for
        the info in this project.</p>
    <p>The main page has a Navbar component at the top with a scrollspy active within the bar. Since my main page is a
        very tall and narrow page, easily navigating the page is assisted by the navbar, and keeping track of where you
        are on the page is made easy with the scrollspy. I also have a toast active when you first connect to the page
        that takes you to this information page. One of the requirements for the project was to have atleast 3 different
        html pages, and while I found it difficult to justify even having two pages, I think the solution I came up with
        is nice. Also if I decide to remove the toast, then this website can function completely on its own outside of
        an academic context.</p>
    <p>Various organizational components, such as accordions, collages, and collapses were all utilized when displaying
        a lot of info that did not need to be read all at the same time. These components take a lot of strain away from
        the viewer and only display info if they desire said info. I opted to use cards when talking about items in the
        Menu Bar because this info is perhaps the most crucial on the whole website so I needed the content to quickly
        grab the viewer's attention. This is also why I used badges with some of the header labels, to break up some of
        the design monotony and match some of the colors you'd see within the program.</p>
    <p>While I used many photos and videos throughout, the carousel component was perfect for displaying all of the
        different screenshots I took of previous projects. The user can stop on the current photo or quickly move to
        another photo if they want to reference something specific.</p>
    <p>I opted to use a modal with a button for activating the quiz to serve as a sort of popup warning for the user, so
        that way they know what's about to happen. It also gives the user the opportunity to stick around if they didn't
        mean to leave yet. The quiz itself is very minimal, as this is the kind of software that is best learned by
        experience rather than memorizing certain little details. I mostly want to encourage a new user of the software
        to get started quickly and never look back, and knowing the specific name of this or that is just not important
        to that aspect of the process.</p>
    <p>Overall, I spent a good amount of time on this project and I can proudly say that I am writing this last part of
        the paragraph 5 minutes from the deadline, so I hope you enjoy reading a little and learning a little about
        something I'm very passionate about.</p>
