    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>Thanks for checking out my Cubase LE AI Elements 11 Beginner's Guide! Hopefully you find the information I
        provide helpful in jumpstarting
        your passion for creating sound. Note that some of this information may be applicable to other versions of
        Cubase, however I will not be
        covering other versions in this guide because LE AI Elements 11 is my prefered version. Before we get started,
        we need to cover some
        preliminary info before we can start the guide.
    </p>
    <h3>Obtaining Cubase</h3>
    <p>You can pick up a copy of Cubase off of their website, digital or physical, the differences are very minimal but
        I will mention them</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Physical editions come in a small cardboard container of some sort, and most likely only contain a download
            code for the digital
            version. I personally own a physical edition and I haven't touched the box since retreiving the code from
            the box, though it is
            a nice souvenir
        </li>
        <li>The Digital edition is obtained through a download code, and you can activate your purchase through the
            Steinberg Download Assistant</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Download Cubase, I reccomend downloading any additional files it suggests unless they seem completely unecessary,
        and run the program</p>
    <h2 id="First">The Startup Screen</h2>
    <p>When first starting Cubase, you will likely get prompted on what audio interface you are currently using. We will
        come back to this later
        in the tutorial but if you don't know what to do, just pick the default interface for your device.</br>
        Anyways, this is what information is given to you on the startup screen: most of which is not important for the
        scope of this tutorial but we will go through anyways.

    <p>The information on the left side is fetched from the Cubase website and usually is articles or news promoted by
        Cubase. On the right we have our many options for creating a new project, the following tabs are breakdowns of
        what each offers though we will focus on creating an Empty project from here on.</p>

                    hopping into the software and picking up where you left off, though accessing Cubase projects can be
                    done even faster by simply looking into the directory where the projects are stored.

                    if that is something you are interested. I'm not here to give you my opinion on it since I honestly
                    do not use it.

                    empty project, since an empty project has the same capabilities as the other project types we have
                    already discussed. Also, if you understand the basic fundamental features of your project, it will
                    make the other project types musch easier to use.

    <h2 id="Second">Create an Empty Project</h2>
    <p>Hold on! Don't go creating that project right away, make sure you have your <strong>project file destination
            folder</strong> set
        to where you want everything to be saved. I created a file on my desktop for this so I can quickly access the
        project files, but keep in mind that this folder can get pretty large so definitely don't select the desktop as
        the folder! This project folder will keep track of various things like recorded audio files, any screenshots you
        take, mixdowns and more.</p>
    </br>
    <p>Once that's taken care of, create an empty project. It should take you to a screen that looks like this:</p>
    <img src="Capture1.PNG" width="900px" alt="capture1">
    <p>Now there's a lot going on in this photo, but we're going to break it all down slowly so you can get comfortable.
        Let's start at the top with the menu bar, and we'll highlight notable and important features for the beginner.

                    functions can be accessed in other ways that we will get into, but it is worth mentioning this is

                    useful link is the <strong>Project Setup</strong> section, which takes us to many configurations of
                    the project. Here we can adjust our project length, framerate of project, and even the file format
                    we output. Having the correct file format can super important, and I reference this part a lot.</p>

                    currently selecting an audio file in our project. You can edit the file in many useful ways here,
                    such as resampling, reversing, muting, and so much more. Once you have audio files in your project,

                    known as the transport panel. We will go over the features of this later, but just know that the

    <h2 id="Third">I'm Ready to start recording! Why can't I start yet?</h2>
    <p>Before we can truly get started, we have to perform a little bit of maintenance to make sure ourr studio is all
        in working order. It's hard to know what is and what isn't going to work immediatley when you start your
        project, but usually it comes down to a few different possibilities.</p>

                    Remember we can configure our studio setup by referring to the <strong>Studio Setup</strong>
                    function from the Studio tab at the top of your screen. Check that you have the correct audio
                    interface plugged in and active within your project. You can change this by referring to which ASIO
                    driver you currently have selected.

                    bring up the audio connections configuration, where you can craete new audio input and outpur buses.
                    I recommend the defualt stereo output bus, but you need to create what works for you for the inputs.
                    For me, I have an audio bus that has all four of my inputs indivually mapped to mono inputs so I can
                    acces one input at a time if I need, but this will all come down to the properties of your
                    interface, how you want to record, and what microphones you are using to record.

                    It's a simple mistake even I make from time to time, and I'm a professional! Just look to the top
                    left of your screen and make sure the thunderbolt icon is an orange color instead of grey, this will
                    set the project to active.

    <p>There are a number of different types of audio tracks available to add to the project, and we can start by right
        clicking in the section just below our input/output channels.
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshot (13).png" alt="screenchot">
    <p>
        You'll see that we can create all sorts of channels, but most of these are likely too complex or simply
        irrelevant to a beginner. For now let's focus on:

    <h3>Possible troubleshooting notes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When your audio track is in place, double check it has the correct input from the input bus by checking the
            inspector on the far left of the screen and opening up the tab with the same name as the Audio track. There
            will be details about the inputs and outpus of the track listed here.</li>
        <li>Something similar can happen to your instrument track, so make sure it is receiving the correct MIDI inputs,
            or receiving MIDI inputs at all in the same section.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Badge code from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/badge/-->
    <h3>Notes about the inspector section for a given track</h3>
    <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-danger text-dark">Track name tab</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Can manage inputs and outputs of a given audio track, or instrument track</li>
        <li>Additional location to touch up panning settings or volume</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-success text-dark">Equalizers</span>
    <ul>
        <li>All Audio tracks come with simple built-in equalizers, so you can modify aspects of your sound here</li>
        <li>These EQ's have only four bands, so use them wisely or find a plugin to download with better EQ settings. I
            personally reccomend TDR Nova.</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-warning text-dark">Inserts</span>
    <ul>
        <li>All plugins are going right here, where you can put in as much as 8 plugins on a single track in our version
            of Cubase, go wild!</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-info text-dark">Sends</span>
    <ul>
        <li>If we also have an FX track in our project, we can send the output of this channel to that FX track for
            additional tweaks.</li>
        <li>There are many crazy things you can do with sends that are beyond the scope of this tutorial.</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-light text-dark">Fader</span>
    <ul>
        <li>If you currently have the MixConsole tab selected near the bottom of your screen, this should all look very
            familiar.</li>
        <li>This is another way to modify the volume and panning of our track</li>
